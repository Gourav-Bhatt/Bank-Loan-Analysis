<h3>Summary Report</h3>
<br>
In order to monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance, we need to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.

- KPI's Requirements <br>
- Good Loan v Bad Loan KPIâ€™s <br>
- Loan Status Grid View

<h3>Details Report</h3>
